I've recreated your Figma design as a React component! Here's what I've implemented based on your screenshot:
Key Features Matched:

Sidebar Navigation

-Company logo/avatar (Acme Co with green circle)
-Navigation items: Home, Jobs, Talent, Messages, Reports
-Active state styling for "Jobs" section
-Settings at the bottom
-"Post a job" button (blue, prominent)

Main Content Area

-Header with "Jobs" title and "Post a job" button
-Tab navigation: All jobs, Drafts, Archived
-Active jobs table with exact columns from your design
-Status badges (Open/Closed with appropriate colors)
-Sample data matching your screenshot
-Settings section at the bottom

Styling Details

-Exact color scheme (green company avatar, blue buttons)
-Proper spacing and typography
-Table styling with hover effects
-Status badge colors (green for Open, gray for Closed)
-Clean, minimal design matching Figma

Interactive Elements

-Clickable navigation items with active states
-Tab switching functionality
-Hover effects on table rows and buttons
-"View job" actions with eye icons

The component is fully responsive and uses Tailwind CSS for styling. You can easily customize the data, add more functionality, or integrate it with your MongoDB backend!
Would you like me to add any specific features or modify any styling details?
